# My Last Match

## Overview
My Last Match (MLM) is a 3D game powered by Unreal Engine 5, developed by the Alien Intelligence team. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world similar to "DayZ" but introduces unique mechanics and features.

## Game Mechanics
- **Control**: Players do not have direct control over characters. Instead, it uses an autochess-like mechanic where actions such as finding food and killing zombies are wrapped into corresponding paper.
- **Graphics**: The game will initially launch with free assets from unreal Engine and later incorporate custom graphics.
- **Game World**: Events happen in the 90s, with realistic elements like the degradation of gasoline, making only diesel vehicles usable.

## Safehouses
- Safehouses act as trading hubs and need protection to maintain their status.
- Top-tier items in the game will include safehouses.
- Players owning safehouses need to keep roads protected from raiders to ensure the safe transport of goods.
