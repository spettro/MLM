# My Last Match

## Overview
My Last Match (MLM) is a 3D game powered by Unreal Engine 5, developed by the Alien Intelligence team. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world similar to "DayZ" but introduces unique mechanics and features.

## Game Mechanics
- **Control**: Players do not have direct control over characters. Instead, it uses an autochess-like mechanic where actions such as finding food and killing zombies are wrapped into corresponding paper.
- **Graphics**: The game will initially launch with free assets from unreal Engine and later incorporate custom graphics.
- **Game World**: Events happen in the 90s, with realistic elements like the degradation of gasoline, making only diesel vehicles usable.

## Map
The map in MLM is a crucial element that defines the game environment and world dynamics. The combination of diverse locations, strategic challenges, and opportunities for player interaction makes the map a central element that influences the entire game. Here are some key details and features related to the map in the game:

### Map Structure and Design
- **Variety of Locations**: The map features diverse types of locations, such as city center, suburbs, parks and fileds, few villages, forests, mountains, and other natural environments. Each location has its unique characteristics and challenges that players must overcome.
- **Post-Apocalyptic Setting**: The map is designed to reflect a post-apocalyptic world where survivors must fight for resources and safety against zombies and other players.
- **Safehouses**: The map includes safehouses that serve as refuges for players. These can be upgraded and used for trading and storing items.
### Game Mechanics Related to the Map
- **Caravan Management**: Caravans move between safehouses, transporting goods. Players can either protect these caravans or attack them, adding a strategic element to the game.
- **Route Protection**: Players who own safehouses must ensure the protection of routes between them to maintain their trade routes safe and attractive to other players.
- **Dangerous Areas**: Some areas on the map are particularly dangerous and require players to adopt a tower-defense style of play to protect their territories from zombie and enemy attacks.
### Map Dynamics
- **Constantly Changing World**: The game world is dynamic, and events can change based on players' actions. This means that each player can influence the overall state of the world through their decisions.
- **Player Interactions**: The map supports interactions between players, whether itâ€™s trading, forming alliances, or engaging in PvP battles.

## Vehicles
- Vehicles play a crucial role in the game, especially diesel-powered ones, as gasoline has degraded.
- Transport and vehicle interaction mechanics are being actively developed and tested.

## Money
### In-Game Banknotes
In MLM, in-game banknotes represent the primary currency used within the game environment. Players use these banknotes to:

- **Trade and Purchase Items**: Banknotes can be used to buy essential supplies, equipment, and other items needed for survival within the game.
- **Crafting and Upgrades**: Players may need banknotes to craft new items or upgrade existing ones, enhancing their gameplay experience and improving their chances of survival.
- **Participate in the In-Game Economy**: Banknotes facilitate transactions between players, allowing for a dynamic and player-driven economy. This helps simulate a real-world economic system within the game, adding depth and realism to the gameplay.
### Qubic (QU)
Qubic (QU) serves as the overarching monetary platform for Paracosm, which integrates with MLM. It operates as both a currency and a means of facilitating economic activities within the game. Here's how Qubic functions in MLM:

- **Conversion and Exchange**: In-game banknotes can be converted 1:1 to Qubic. This allows players to seamlessly transition between the in-game economy and the broader Paracosm economic ecosystem.
- **Monetization**: Players can earn Qubic through various in-game activities, such as looting valuable items, crafting high-demand goods, or participating in strategic gameplay elements. This play-to-earn model incentivizes players to engage deeply with the game.
- **Trading and Selling**: Qubic enables players to trade and sell in-game items both within MLM and potentially across other games or platforms within the Paracosm universe. This adds a layer of real-world value to the time and effort players invest in the game.
- **Burn Mechanism**: Shareholders in MLM have the power to vote on how much Qubic should be burned during in-game item purchases. This burning mechanism helps regulate the supply of Qubic, maintaining its value and ensuring economic stability within the game.

## Game Development and Testing
- The development team consists of 2 developers for the prototype coding, 3 for game design, and uses standard graphics from Unreal Engine 5.
- The game is currently in the game design stage, with an editor for locations almost completed.
- An early access version will be available before the full launch, with cross-platform compatibility planned for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

## Game Strategy
- **Player Economy**: The game uses a player-driven economy where mastering gameplay can lead to earning real money.
- **Real Money Trading**: In-game money is convertible to QUBIC tokens at a fixed 1:1 ratio while the character is in a safehouse.
- **Non-Pay-to-Win**: The game does not feature pay-to-win mechanics. Instead, players can purchase multiple attempts to accomplish tasks if their character dies.

## Future Development
- **IPO**: The game had an initial public offering (IPO) where each of the 676 shareholders received 1 share for 701,000,000 qubic and 1 safehouse based on the order of their bids.
- **Content Addition**: Post-IPO, additional content such as new cars and items will be added.

## Community Involvement
- The community is encouraged to provide crafting recipes and participate in early testing phases.
- Testing phases focus on ensuring server stability and testing gameplay mechanics.

## Miscellaneous
- **Security**: The game uses an authoritative server to validate actions and prevent cheating.
- **Trading and Items**: In-game items and money are tradeable, with items only being traded for QUBIC tokens unless over-the-counter (OTC) trades are arranged.
