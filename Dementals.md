# Dementals

## Overview
Dementals are a unique type of NPC in the game MLM representing humans who have lost their sanity due to extreme fear and the influence of mares. They exhibit behaviors similar to zombies but have distinct characteristics that influence the game's mechanics and strategy.

## Characteristics
- **Origin**: Dementals are created when a character loses their sanity, often due to the presence of mares or extreme fear. Unlike traditional zombies, they retain some human characteristics.
- **Behavior**: 
  - Dementals are attracted to noise and light, making strategic planning crucial for players to avoid attracting them.
  - They exhibit a specific reaction to mares, freezing and staring at them when encountered.
  - They have basic survival needs, such as eating and drinking water, and can die of hunger. However, they can resort to cannibalism, eating other dementals to survive.
  - Dementals do not attack each other due to recognizing the "insanity aura" around them, but they will eat raw flesh from dead bodies if they are hungry.

## Abilities and Limitations
- **Skills**: 
  - Dementals retain some physical skills from their human state, but they lose the ability to perform complex cognitive tasks. For example, a fitness trainer will remain physically strong but won't have precise control over weapons like firearms.
  - They can use weapons and tools in a rudimentary way, similar to "a monkey with a gun," indicating a lack of precision and strategy in their use.
- **Looting**: 
  - Dementals carry items they had before losing their mind and any items they pick up afterward. They drop these items when killed, providing valuable loot for players.
  - They do not drop any special items specific to their state, maintaining a focus on realism rather than introducing fantasy elements.

## Interaction with Players
- **Transformation**: 
  - When a player character becomes a demental, the player loses control of that character. The character can still be observed, allowing the player to potentially retrieve lost items with the help of friends.
- **Combat and Strategy**: 
  - Players can use light strategically to scare away mares but must be cautious as it will also attract dementals.
  - Dementals can be used strategically by players to control areas, as they can block or attack other players and NPCs.
- **Resurrection**: 
  - Upon a player's death and transformation into a demental, they have the option to resurrect in a safehouse. The cost of resurrection is determined by the game's shareholders.

## Sanity Mechanism
- **Sanity Loss**: 
  - Fear and the presence of mares cause characters to lose sanity, leading to the transformation into dementals. This mechanic emphasizes the psychological horror element of the game.
- **Recovery**: 
  - There is no direct mechanism for recovering a demental back to a sane state; once transformed, the character remains a demental until killed.

## Lore and Background
- **Cultural References**: 
  - The concept of dementals is inspired by various folkloric and psychological elements, creating a unique blend of horror and survival mechanics within the game.

## Strategic Use
- **Controlling Areas**: 
  - Players can use dementals strategically to guard areas by luring them with noise and light. This can create barriers for other players or NPCs, effectively controlling access to certain zones.
- **Loot Management**: 
  - By manipulating dementals' behavior, players can influence where items are dropped, potentially setting up ambushes or securing valuable loot.
