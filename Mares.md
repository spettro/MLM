# Mares

## Overview
Mares are a crucial element in the MLM contributing significantly to the game's atmosphere and mechanics. They are inspired by folklore and serve as an omnipresent threat in the game's dark environments.

## Characteristics
- **Appearance and Visibility**: Mares are invisible entities that can only be sensed indirectly. Their presence can be detected by observing animals like cats staring into dark corners of rooms.
- **Behavior**: 
  - Mares wander in darkness and cause characters to lose mental energy when nearby, akin to losing hit points but related to the mind.
  - They do not chase players but instead affect those who venture too close.
  - They instill a sense of paranoia and fear, making the dark areas of the game particularly treacherous.

## Interaction with Other Entities
- **Impact on Players**: 
  - Players need to stay close to light sources to avoid the debilitating effects of mares.
  - If a player loses too much sanity, they may become a demental, losing control of their character.
- **Impact on Dementals**: 
  - Dementals, characters who have lost their sanity, are also influenced by mares. When dementals see a mare, they stop reacting and start staring at it.
  - This mechanic indicates that dementals have lost their sanity due to the mares' influence.

## Game Mechanics
- **Light and Darkness**:
  - Light scares mares away but simultaneously attracts other dangers like dementals and human NPCs.
  - Darkness can sometimes be safe if no mares are present, allowing players to survive without immediate harm.
- **Sanity Mechanism**: 
  - The game employs a sanity mechanism where proximity to mares reduces a player's mental energy. This necessitates strategic movement and careful planning when navigating dark areas.
  - Players can temporarily observe their demental characterâ€™s actions but cannot control them, adding a layer of complexity to the gameplay.

## Lore
- **Origin**: The concept of mares in the game draws from folklore, where a mare is a malicious entity that brings on nightmares by sitting on a person's chest while they sleep.
- **Role in the Apocalypse**: In the game's lore, the appearance of mares is directly tied to the apocalyptic events that have transformed the world into its current state.

## Strategic Considerations
- **Avoidance and Navigation**: 
  - Players must balance the need for light to keep mares at bay with the risk of attracting other threats.
  - Understanding the behavior of mares and dementals is key to surviving and thriving in the game world.
- **Resource Management**: 
  - Managing light sources becomes crucial, as running out of light can leave players vulnerable to mares.
