# Safehouses

## Overview
The game features 676 safehouses, each with unique characteristics and varying levels of desirability. Safehouses are crucial elements of the gameplay, acting as trading hubs, shelters, and strategic points for players. Safehouse ownership is permanent, and they can only be bought from existing owners.

## Safehouse Mechanics
- **Reincarnation**: Players will reincarnate in a safehouse upon death. The cost of reincarnation is set by MLM shareholders, with 50% of the fee going to the safehouse owner.
- **Trading**: In-game trading within safehouses involves trading items for qus. Players can trade inside or outside of safehouses, but trading inside incurs no fee.
